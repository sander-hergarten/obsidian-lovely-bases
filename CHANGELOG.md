This release has been focused on improving the cards component overall, by including many powerful features and integrating them into the existing components

### Added

#### Cards

- **Render content**: A highly requested feature, now cards can render the notes content below the properties section
- **Overlay layout**: A new layout that prioritizes images, ideal for media collections
- **Polaroid layout**: The layout that was already included in the infinite gallery has been reimplemented and is available in all card components with new features.
- **Custom links**: associate a URL or an alternative note for Mod + click, allowing you, for example, to open your favorite series directly from the view.
- **Badges**: A new way to showcase properties.
- **Render Image files**: It is now possible to view images in JPG, PNG, WebP and more
- **Translated Configuration**: View settings are now available in 10 languages.
- **Fallback Icons on Images**: When an entry has no image, an icon associated with the file type (markdown, base, canvas...) will be displayed instead of an empty space.

#### Carousel

All the new card options, plus:

- **Grouping**: The carousel component supports groupings, allowing you to build richer views in the style of Netflix.

#### Infinite Gallery

- **Card features**: The infinite gallery has been overwritten to work with the Card component internally. All new Card features are available here as well.

#### Linear Calendar

- **Custom Title property** Use a different property instead of the file name.

### Changed

- Lucide Icons are now rendered using Obsidian `setIcon` API
- Build is now minified so the bundle size is much smaller
